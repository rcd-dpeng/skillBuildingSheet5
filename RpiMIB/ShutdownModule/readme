To set up the power_shutdown module:

Make sure the repo is cloned in Documents

First, copy the power_shutdown folder into the proper modules folder with the command:
sudo cp -r /home/pi/Documents/RaspberryPiCommon/RpiMIB/ShutdownModule/power_shutdown /lib/modules/4.14.69-v7+/kernel/drivers

Then, find the module's dependency, making it visible to modprobe by running the commands:
cd /lib/modules/4.14.69-v7+/kernel/drivers/power_shutdown
sudo depmod

Then, add power_shutdown to the list of modules to be installed on boot by running the following commands:
cd
sudo su
echo power_shutdown >> /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf

Finally, reboot the Raspberyy Pi
