# Begin Here - Overview

## SlushEngine, Raspberry Pi, Python, Kivy

These four components comprise what the DPEA calls a "Raspberry Pi project." This colloquialism refers to both the hardware (Slush Engine and RaspberryPi) and software (Python and Kivy) involved.

### SlushEngine
The SlushEngine is a hardware driver that works with the Raspberry Pi to move (stepper) motors with speed and simplicity. Your SlushEngine is physically connected to your project and its stepper motors.

Take time to review a more in-depth overview of the SlushEngine hardware at jfkjdfhkjgh. 

### Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi is a (physical) computer small enough to fit on the SlushEngine. When you run your programs, etc. on a tablet/monitor using a command prompt, IDE, or any methods of execution, the Raspberry Pi is what enables you to do that.

Again, see kjfhgkjdfhg to visualize where the Raspberry Pi is positioned in respect to the SlushEngine

### Python

### Kivy
