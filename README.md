# Begin Here - Overview

## SlushEngine, Raspberry Pi, Python, Kivy

These four components comprise what the DPEA calls a "Raspberry Pi project." This colloquialism refers to both the hardware (Slush Engine and RaspberryPi) and software (Python and Kivy) involved.

### SlushEngine
SlushEngine is a hardware driver that works with the Raspberry Pi to move (stepper) motors with speed and simplicity. Your SlushEngine is physically connected to your project and its Stepper motors.
